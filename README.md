## Brief documentation
### Overview
The 'CoM Crowdin PL injector' is a primitive 'ad-hoc made' Google Chrome extension for injecting Polish strings (and optionally also voiceover audio) to the Crowdin editor page. The Polish strings used by injector were obtained from CoM github on February 5th, 2022.

The voiceover audiofiles were extracted from The Chronicles Of Myrtana: Archolos v1.2.2 *.mod files..

The performance is not optimal, sometimes the Polish text doesn't appear. In that case, click on another string and then click back on the previous one. If that doesnâ€™t help, try resetting injector by clicking on the extension button in the Extensions menu in the Chrome bar.

**WARNING: Extension works based on the Crowdin website structure as of March 22nd, 2022. Should any changes in the structure of website happen, the extension might not work properly anymore.**
